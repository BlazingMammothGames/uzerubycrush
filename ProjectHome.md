Bejeweled is a simple, yet amazingly fun puzzle game from PopCap Games. The intention of this project is to bring a clone of the game to the open source 8-bit Uzebox gaming console.

All the graphics, sound, and game programming has been done by myself (Adrastos in the Uzebox community), though if anyone would like to contribute they would be more than welcome! (kudos to Uze for his wonderful engine and system).

Current version is 1.0. If you spot any bugs, please let me know!

Thanks, and enjoy!
