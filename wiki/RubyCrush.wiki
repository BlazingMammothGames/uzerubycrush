Ruby Crush is an open source clone of Bejeweled (or any other match-3 game). It is currently single player, with two modes: Classic and Timed.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay is more or less identical to Bejeweled, or any other match-3 games floating about. The goal is to get at least 3 gems of the same type in a horizontal or vertical row. You do this by swapping two adjacent gems. The only way you can swap a gem is if doing so would line up at least 3 gems of the same type in a row. Getting at least 3 gems in a row clears those gems, and new ones drop down from the top of the board. In both modes, you can get a hint about which gem can be moved to score some points. Note that this is not necessarily the best move possible, it's just *a* move, in case you get stuck.

===Classic Mode===
In Classic mode, the goal is simply to get the highest score possible. The game is over when no more moves on the board exist. You start the game with 3 available hints, and get an extra hint every time you level up. There is no time limit to anything that you do.

===Timed Mode===
In Timed mode, you're on the clock! The green bar at the bottom is your timer - if it becomes fully depleted, it's game over! You level up by scoring enough points quickly enough to beat the timer. You have unlimited hints in this mode, but be careful - each hint you use removes 10 seconds from your timer!

==Controls==
* D-pad: controls the menu and moves the gem selector around
* A: activates menu items, and selects a gem to be swapped. To swap a gem, press 'A' while on the gem you want to swap, then press the d-pad in the direction of the gem you want to swap with.
* B: back out of menu screens
* Start: Bring up the pause menu, resume the game after level up or game over.
* Select: Show a hint

==Todo==
Nothing?

===Known Bugs===
None, at the moment.

==Disclaimer==
I have only tested this project under the emulator so far, not on the actual box (as I don't have one yet). As far as I know, everything should be fine on the actual box, but don't blame me if something goes wrong.
